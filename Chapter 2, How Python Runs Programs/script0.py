'''
In its simplest form, a Python program is just a text file containing Python statements.
For example, the following file, named script0.py, is one of the simplest Python scripts
I could dream up, but it passes for a fully functional Python program:
'''

print('hello world')
print(2 ** 100)

'''
This file contains two Python print statements, which simply print a string (the text in
quotes) and a numeric expression result (2 to the power 100) to the output stream.
