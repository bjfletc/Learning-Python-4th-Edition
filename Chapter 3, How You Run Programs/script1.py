'''
Letâ€™s get started. Open your favorite text editor (e.g., vi, Notepad, or the IDLE editor),
and type the following statements into a new text file named script1.py:
'''

# A first Python script
import sys              # Load a library module
print(sys.platform)
print(2 ** 100)         # Raise 2 to a power
x = 'Spam!'
print(x * 8)            # String repetition
